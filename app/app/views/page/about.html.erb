<h2>About this project</h2>

<p>This started as a "<em>coding challenge</em>"
for a position of Software Engineer on CGTrader</p>

<p>The idea is that it will perform searchs on a
database of <em>prompts</em> used for <strong>Stable-Diffusion</strong>
App, you describe something and it gives you an image generated by AI.
The <em>raw data</em> was curated by Gustavo Santana and may be
acquired in the following link:
